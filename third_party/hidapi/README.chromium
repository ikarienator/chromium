Description:
HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface with
USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. While it
can be used to communicate with standard HID devices like keyboards, mice, and
Joysticks, it is most useful when used with custom (Vendor-Defined) HID devices.

Local Modifications:

1. Only needed files are included:
  - src/hidapi.h
  - src/linux/hid.c -> hidapi_linux.c
  - src/mac/hid.c -> hidapi_mac.c
  - src/windows/hid.c -> hidapi_win.c

3. Fixed license header (pending change to the upstream).
